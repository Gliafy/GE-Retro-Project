# What We Are Most Proud Of
1) We are mostly proud of the groovy and random environment we achieved with the kitchen setting. 
2) We are also proud of how we can interact with more than one thing (see interactables).

# What We Learned
1) How to make the scene work with a VR Headset.
2) How to iterate HSV base colors on the disco ball and floodlights.
3) How to implement different features and combine them to create a vibe.
4) How to be creative with combining different features.
